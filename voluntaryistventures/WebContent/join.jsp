<h1>How to get involved ...</h1>

You need not quit your day job. Instead, simply find a project that interests you and request to join it or create your own and contribute to it as you are able to in your free time.

Consistent with our values and beliefs there are "no rules" as to how projects choose to organize themselves and compensate their members. Each project should make these decisions on their own. Thatâ€™s the "self-organizing" part.

We recommend that anyone who contributes to a project should share our desire for a voluntary society, our belief in how it can be realized and our strategy for manifesting the dream.  However, strictly speaking, these things are not required. 

The single requirement we have for involvement in any project which seeks to utilize the Voluntaryist Ventures brand name is that all members of the project must take the Non-Aggression Pledge.

All projects are completely independent. Voluntaryist Ventures is merely a brand name a project may or may not choose to leverage if its members agree to take the Non-Aggression Pledge.
