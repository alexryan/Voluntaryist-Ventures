<h1>What is Voluntaryism?</h1>
Voluntaryism is the doctrine that relations between people should be by mutual consent, or not at all. 
Voluntaryists dream of a better world.
A world without coercion, force, aggression, violence and war.
Voluntaryists dream of a voluntary society achieved by voluntary means.

<h1>What is Voluntaryist Ventures?</h1>

Voluntaryist Ventures is not a company. 
We are to the company as the un-conference is to the conference.
You can think of us as the un-company. 
We are a decentralized network of self-organizing free men and women working to achieve a voluntary society by a novel means.
<br/><br/>

<h1>Our Perspective</h1>

In order to understand the mission of Voluntaryist Ventures it is necessary to first understand our perspective.

At times, the inability to control fear may lead all of us to feel the temptation to use coercion or outright force to inflict our   will on others.
The lack of this skill is the root cause of all conflict and violence between individuals.
The lack of this skill is the root cause of the division of society into waring tribes of "us" and "them" and the creation of hierachical power structures within those tribes.
The lack of this skill is the root cause of the existence and growth of the oppressive nation state.
The lack of this skill is the root cause of the unrelenting barrage of stifiling laws, rules and regulation that sucks the joy out of life, grinds economies to a halt, and plunges us into economic crisis.
The lack of this skill is what eventually leads to the paralysis of the nation state and the ascent to power of totalitarian forces.
The lack of this skill is the root cause of the unrelenting war and barbarism that consumes much of our world.
The lack of this skill is the root cause of the feeling of learned helplessness which leads individuals to mistakenly believe that they cannot make a difference in the world.
From this perspective it becomes apparent that the development of this skill is an urgent necessity if we wish to avoid destroying ourselves.

The development of this skill is an urgent necessity for the preservation of the human race.

Voluntaryist Ventures was founded based on this insight and with understanding that the same pattern of self-destruction which exists in the nation state also exists within the corporation.

<h1>Our Mission</h1> 
We believe that the hierachical power structures of the modern corporation breed bureaucracy, inefficiency, waste and corruption. 

We aim to prove to the world that, in time, a sufficiently motivated self-organizing system of free men and women can outperform any hierarchically organized competitor in any market no matter how big the odds. 

The command economies of the communist world were outperformed by the free market economies of the west and eventually fell. This happened despite the fact that the governments of those countries had massive resources at their disposal. For the same reason, the hiearchical power structures of the modern corporation will be outperformed by and will fall to the dyanism of self-organized free men and women.

We believe that the force of freedom is so powerful that any and all challengers will be swept away even in a non-free marketplace where the cards are stacked against it. 

Our goal is nothing less than relegation of the very idea of the corporation to the dustbin of history. 

With each victory we will win more hearts and minds to the cause of freedom and inspire others to follow in our footsteps.

We believe that the force which drives people to create hierarchical power structures in their companies is the same force which leads to the creation of that hierarchical power structures in all organizations. 

One such organization deserves special mention. The institution we refer to as "the state". This corrupt and evil mafia-like institution robs each of us at gun-point of a huge portion of our wealth and uses it to finance all many of aggression against all manner of people both at home and abroad, murdering millions and imprisoning millions more for violating its increasingly arbitrary and immoral laws.

We aim to eliminate not only the corporation but to eliminate the state as well. Most people already know that such institutions are inherently evil but fear leads many believe them to be necessary evils. We aim to prove in practice that such institutions and their power structures are unneccessary and that living our lives as truly free men and women pursuing our dreams with a clear conscience that comes from neither engaging in nor supporting aggression is the true path to happiness.

We believe that ending the existence of the state is an urgent task. We must accomplish this goal before the cycle of history repeats itself and the economic depression caused by the the state leads to the ascension to power of totalitarian forces who would possess the resources to commit mass murder on a scale heretofore unimaginable.

Saving humanity from this fate is the passion that drives us.
